            <h1>Opioids Addiction Treatment and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>EThe synthetic version of natural opiates, opioids serve actual medical purposes to relieve acute or temporary pain. When administered properly, opioids relieve physical pain related to ailments, injuries, and medical issues.<br/><br/>Opioids are a class of drug that includes legal, potent, and frequently misused drugs like fentanyl, illegal drugs like heroin, and legal prescription drugs like hydrocodone, morphine, and oxycodone.<br/><br/>Commonly prescribed and well-known opioids include the drugs Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Fentanyl, and Methadone, as well as non-prescriptive products such as NyQuil and TheraFlu.</p><br/>

              <p>Medical use aside, opiates can be highly addictive and are often misused. People who receive opiates for medical remedies begin to build up a tolerance to the euphoric sensation associated with opiates, and can quickly find themselves on a fast path to addiction.<br/><br/>Like many other addictive substances, opiate addiction is a vicious cycle of high and chasing the high. The user will begin to suffer physical withdrawal symptoms and go to extreme lengths to obtain more opiates.<br/><br/>As they continue to use opiates, their body will require higher amounts over time to achieve the same euphoric feelings.</p>

          <h1>Opiates vs. Opioids</h1>
          <p>The difference between opiates and opioids is slight but distinct. Both opiates and opioids are technically considered ‘narcotics’. However, most opioids are synthetic or made in a lab. Commonly, opiates and opioids when discussed together are referred to as opioids.

                <h1>Opiate Withdrawal</h1>
                <p>Once the initial high runs out, the addictive nature of the withdrawal may cause users to turn to more narcotics (often obtained illicitly) as they chase the high or counteract withdrawal symptoms.<br/><br/>And once you develop an opioid addiction, the withdrawal can seriously impede your ability to function, and can even be life-threatening. Physical dependence and drug tolerance both play a factor in the severity of withdrawal symptoms. </p>
