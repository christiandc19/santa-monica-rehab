                  <h1>HEROIN ADDICTION SYMPTOMD AND TREATMENT</h1>
                  <p>Heroin is an opioid stimulant created from morphine and the seed of the poppy plant. It usually appears in either powder form or as a sticky tar substance (‘black tar heroin’).<br/>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, around 80% of heroin users begin using prescription drugs before they eventually turn to heroin.<br/> Heroin can be taken in several ways, typically by injection, snorting, or smoking. It can also be combined with other drugs, like crack cocaine (called “Speedballing”).</p><br/><br/>

                  <p>Heroin can be dangerous and in many cases, life-threatening, especially for users with increased tolerance and dependency on the drug. Overdose typically begins with a slowed breathing (hypoxia) that eventually leads to a lack of oxygen to the brain, which can cause brain damage, coma, and eventually death.</p>
                  <h1>Heroin Withdrawal</h1>
                  <p>Heroin use affects the brain’s receptors and causes a euphoric sensation, thus making it an extremely addictive substance.
