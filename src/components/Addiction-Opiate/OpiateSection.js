            <h1>Opiates Addiction Treatment and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>Easily addictive and often associated with synthetic opioids, opiates are considered 'natural opioids'. Opiates are the naturally occurring version of opioid drugs, directly from the seed of the poppy plant. Common types of opiates include: </p><br/>
            <ul>
                <li><BsDot/> Opium</li>
                <li><BsDot/> Heroin</li>
                <li><BsDot/> Codeine</li>
                <li><BsDot/> Morphine</li>
              </ul><br/>
              <p>Medically, opiates treat pain. Legal opiates/opioids are prescribed to treat a variety of conditions: </p><br/>
            <ul>
                <li><BsDot/> Cough suppression</li>
                <li><BsDot/> Diarrhea</li>

              <p>Medical use aside, opiates can be highly addictive and are often misused. People who receive opiates for medical remedies begin to build up a tolerance to the euphoric sensation associated with opiates, and can quickly find themselves on a fast path to addiction.<br/><br/>Like many other addictive substances, opiate addiction is a vicious cycle of high and chasing the high. The user will begin to suffer physical withdrawal symptoms and go to extreme lengths to obtain more opiates.<br/><br/>As they continue to use opiates, their body will require higher amounts over time to achieve the same euphoric feelings.</p>

          <h1>Opiates vs. Opioids</h1>
          <p>The difference between opiates and opioids is slight but distinct. Both opiates and opioids are technically considered ‘narcotics’. However, most opioids are synthetic or made in a lab. Commonly, opiates and opioids when discussed together are referred to as opioids.

                <h1>Opiate Withdrawal</h1>
                <p>Once the initial high runs out, the addictive nature of the withdrawal may cause users to turn to more narcotics (often obtained illicitly) as they chase the high or counteract withdrawal symptoms.<br/><br/>And once you develop an opioid addiction, the withdrawal can seriously impede your ability to function, and can even be life-threatening. Physical dependence and drug tolerance both play a factor in the severity of withdrawal symptoms. </p>

              <p>Opiate treatment options are available, and every prescribed treatment plan will look slightly different.
