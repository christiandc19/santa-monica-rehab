                    <h1>KRATOM ADDICTION</h1><br/>
                    <p>Kratom (a.k.a. Ketum, kakuam, or biak) is an herbal substance derived from the leaf of a Southeast Asian tree. Although it is relatively new on the scene and estimated kratom usage in the United States is not clear, it has been used as a traditional remedy in Southeast Asia for centuries.
                    <br/>Users of kratom feel a stimulating sensation similar to those associated with opioids (relaxation, euphoria, relief). Kratom is typically ingested by capsule or by mixing in a drink. It produces an opioid-like sensation that begins place quickly, almost immediately.<br/></p>

                  <p>Due to a relatively short time on the scene, there is still much to learn and study about the true effects of kratom use. What we do know for sure is that the effects of kratom use depend on a variety of circumstantial factors, including:</p><br/>
                    <ul>

                      <li><BsDot/> Underlying medical conditions</li>
                    </ul><br/>
                  <p>A low kratom dose generally acts as a more subdued stimulant, and a high dose (especially when mixed with other drugs) produces a heightened sensation. Symptoms of low and high dose kratom use include:</p>
                    <h5>Low Dose</h5>

                      <p>Dosage levels aside, kratom is particularly dangerous when combined with other stimulants. Although kratom is also not officially listed in the Controlled Substances Act, overdose from kratom use is a very real possibility when mixed with other drugs. Symptoms of a kratom overdose can include:</p><br/>

                      <li><BsDot/> Lethargy</li>
