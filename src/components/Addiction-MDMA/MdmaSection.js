            <h1>MDMA Addiction Treatment and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>Commonly referred to as Ecstasy, ‘E’, or ‘Molly’, MDMA is a prevalent street and party drug that gives the user a heightened sense of euphoria, energy, and sexual excitement. MDMA became more widely used in the 1970s and 80s, at which point the DEA officially placed it on the list of Schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 drugs are those that are most potent.<br/><br/>MDMA is an empathogen, that is, a drug that increases one’s empathy and compassion towards others. Continued MDMA use appears to affect the body’s dopamine and serotonin levels associated with substance use disorders.<br/>Several factors determine any individual’s reaction to MDMA intake, including other stimulants present in the body, your body’s metabolism, preexisting conditions, the strength of the batch, and the dosage amount.</p>

          <h1>Coming Down After MDMA</h1>
          <p>Coming down after MDMA use is a process that can take several days to leave the body. This withdrawal depends on the specific dosage amount and your body’s metabolism. A few of the basic symptoms of MDMA withdrawal include:

          <h1>Dehydration and Overhydration</h1>
          <p>When you take MDMA, there is a risk of dehydration, and in some cases, heat stroke. This is because MDMA causes you to sweat profusely, particularly in an active environment. Many people who use ecstasy take it in conjunction with social environments of high energy, dancing, and hot/humid exteriors and interiors (music festivals, concerts, dance clubs, etc.).  <br/><br/>MDMA risks your body temperature rising to a dangerous level, and sometimes even heat stroke. Your body's temperature rising can also lead to overhydration, as one feels the need to replenish your body.

          <h1>Effects of MDMA Use</h1>
          <p>Although not as highly addictive as other drugs like meth or fentanyl, the euphoria and ‘peaking’ sensation of MDMA can lead the user to feel the need to do more or to mix MDMA with other substances to increase the high (especially alcohol, cocaine, or antidepressants).
