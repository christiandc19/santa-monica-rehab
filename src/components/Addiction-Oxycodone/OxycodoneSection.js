            <h1>Oxycodone Addiction Treatment and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>A powerful substance and one of the significant contributing drugs to the opioid epidemic in the United States. <br/><br/>Oxycodone is a synthetic opiate intended to be prescribed to treat mild to intense pain. The only problem; it is also highly addictive and increasingly abused outside of its medicinal purposes.<br/><br/>Oxycodone (also known as ‘Oxy’ or ‘oxies’) is typically consumed in the form of a pill, but can also be crushed up into a powder and injected. Due to its strength, quick effectiveness, and euphoric effects, the user’s body becomes easily dependent on usage, thus starting a vicious cycle of abuse.<br/><br/>Even if you begin taking legal oxycodone to fight pain, oxycodone dependance can develop into addiction rapidly as your body depends and demands on the high and your tolerance for the drug increases.Oxycodone delivers a sensation or feeling of euphoria, sedation, reduction of anxiety, and relaxation. It is no coincidence that as the prescriptions of Oxycodone increased in recent years, so too have addiction rates.</p><br/>
