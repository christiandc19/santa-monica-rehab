            <h1>Fentanyl Addiction Treatment and Symptoms</h1>
            <p>An opioid originally created as a painkiller for cancer patients, fentanyl has since developed into a popular and highly addictive street drug due to its potency and relatively cheap price. 
            <br/> <br/> Especially when combined and sold on the street with other street drugs, fentanyl is extremely potent. It is typically up to 50 times stronger than heroin and 50-100 times stronger than morphine. It can be consumed in several forms. A few of the most common include:</p><br/>

              <h1>What Fentanyl Addiction Looks Like</h1>
              <p>Fentanyl is fast-acting, and produces a brief and intense feeling of euphoria. The dopamine reward following a fentanyl dose typically leads to a rapid and overwhelming addiction as your mind and body crave that feeling again.<br/><br/>Just 2mg of fentanyl is considered a lethal dose. This leads to increased risk of addiction for fentanyl abusers as their tolerance increases.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems with illicit fentanyl use is the inability to measure dosage. American Addiction Center estimates that from 2020 to 2021, deaths from opioid abuse (predominately fentanyl) increased by about 10,000 people in the United States.

            <p>Fentanyl does have medical uses, and was originally designed to treat severe pain. This level of accessibility also means that there is a greater chance of ‘diversion’, that is, individuals with a prescription getting their hands on batches of the drug to mix and sell it as a third party.<br/><br/>Because fentanyl is a medicine treatment alternative, it is also at risk of abuse. Some users even extract it from the patch and inject it directly. Imprecise intake methods and can make it difficult to measure the dosage, leading to higher highs for the abuser, and subsequently, stronger addiction, and eventually, increased mortality rates.</p>
